# How to Find Out Someone's IP Address on Xbox Live
 
If you want to know the IP address of another player on Xbox Live, you might be tempted to use a tool called an IP grabber. An IP grabber is a software that can capture the IP address of anyone who joins your party or game on Xbox Live. However, using an IP grabber is not only illegal, but also risky. You could expose your own IP address to hackers, get banned from Xbox Live, or even face legal consequences.

Fortunately, there is a safer and more legitimate way to find out someone's IP address on Xbox Live. You can use a feature called Xbox Console Companion, which is a Windows 10 app that lets you connect your Xbox account to your PC. With Xbox Console Companion, you can see the network information of anyone who is in your party or game on Xbox Live. Here's how to do it:
 
1. Download and install Xbox Console Companion from the Microsoft Store on your PC.
2. Sign in with the same Microsoft account that you use on your Xbox console.
3. On the left sidebar, click on the Party icon.
4. Join or create a party with the person whose IP address you want to find out.
5. On the right side of the party window, click on the Settings icon.
6. Select Network Statistics.
7. You will see a list of all the members in your party and their network information, including their IP address.

Note that this method only works if you are in a party or game with the person whose IP address you want to find out. You cannot use it to find out the IP address of anyone who is not in your party or game. Also, be careful not to misuse this information for malicious purposes. Respect the privacy and security of other players on Xbox Live.
  
## How to Protect Your Own IP Address on Xbox Live
 
While Xbox Console Companion can help you find out someone's IP address on Xbox Live, it can also expose your own IP address to others. This could make you vulnerable to cyberattacks, such as DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, which can slow down or disrupt your internet connection. To prevent this from happening, you should take some steps to protect your own IP address on Xbox Live. Here are some tips:

- Avoid using IP grabbers or other tools that can compromise your network security.
- Do not join parties or games with strangers or people you do not trust.
- Block or report any users who harass you or threaten you online.
- Use a VPN (virtual private network) service that can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic.
- Change your router settings to enable firewall protection and disable UPnP (universal plug and play).

By following these tips, you can enjoy playing on Xbox Live without worrying about your IP address being exposed or attacked. Remember to always be respectful and responsible when interacting with other players on Xbox Live.
  
## Conclusion
 
Finding out someone's IP address on Xbox Live can be useful for various reasons, such as troubleshooting network issues or reporting abusive users. However, using an IP grabber or other illegal tools can be dangerous and unethical. Instead, you can use Xbox Console Companion, a Windows 10 app that lets you see the network information of anyone who is in your party or game on Xbox Live. This way, you can find out someone's IP address without breaking the law or risking your own security.
